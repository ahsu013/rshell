rshell overview
	rshell is a simple custom shell. it a more limitated version of bash shell. it execute commands by calling execvp command in /bin.

	knonw bug and/or limitation:
		echo into file does not work
		echo with message that has # does not echo anything after #
		rshell can not handle differient connectors. it will prompt "syntax error if it detects mutliple different connectors
		connectors at the end of commands will be ignore
		multiple connectors without commands in between will prompt "syntax error" 
		rshell currently can not cycle through past commands. 
		rshell currently can not auto complete with tab key

		special built in "exit" command will exit the custom shell. 
 
cp overview

	cp is a program that moves the content of a file into another. the default method is to use the max size buffer to copy the content. this is the fastest way to do so. if optional flag "-o" is pass in, it will use all three method and display the wallclock/user timer/system time.   


ls overview
	ls is custom command and has the same functionality as bash's ls command with some limitation. the accepted flags are -l -r -a -r. user can combine flags to get the wanted result. the default order is alphabetical order  
	-a: list all hidden files
	-r: list files in reverse order
	-r: recursivly call to display all files within folders. 
	-l: displays with long formate listing extra information pertaining to the file. 
		extra infomations are order:
			total number of files in directory.
			the type of file.
			user read/write/execute permission.
			group read/write/execute permission.	
			other read/write/execute permission.
			number of links.
			user name.
			group name.
			file size.	
			time of last modification. 
			name of file.
